  /**
   * Scenery that is alive but is not a Creature, in Pumpkin Hollow: the
   * harvest moon and its glow, which breathes slowly; a few stars twinkling;
   * the candle in the farmhouse window brightening and dimming; a far skein
   * of geese crossing now and then; autumn leaves drifting down, far ones
   * behind the animals and near ones in front; low mist drifting between the
   * pumpkins; and the pumpkin patch's pumpkins, jack-o'-lanterns, corn
   * bundles and hay bales. Present from the first second of every Session,
   * never earned, never counted. Nothing here has the signature eye, and
   * everything is slow: this runs on a projector all day.
   *
   * It also holds Too Loud's wind (`scene.css`): the clouds that slide over
   * the moon and the blown leaves that streak across, both hidden until the
   * room gets loud, and moved by transitions rather than animations, since
   * Too Loud holds every animation still.
   *
   * The moon is its own piece rather than part of the backdrop because the
   * backdrop stretches with the screen, and a moon must stay round. Both
   * pieces are centred 78% across the landscape and 20% down, behind every
   * Creature, so the Great Boo loops in front of it.
   *
   * The artwork is `src/lib/scenes/halloween/ambient/`; the scatter below is
   * what places it. Positions are fixed rather than random, so the Scene
   * looks the same each time a teacher opens it.
   */

  /**
   * Everything sitting in the patch. `x` is the piece's centre across the
   * landscape and `base` its distance from the bottom of the Scene, both in
   * %. The patch runs from in front of the trees' feet (base 29) to the
   * bottom; beyond it is open meadow, where nothing sits, and the giant
   * strides along the back of that (base 36 to 40). Ground animals walk the
   * whole depth, from 62% of the way down (base 38) to 97% (base 3). `width` is in px
   * against a 1920px-wide Scene at the middle of the patch: pieces scale with
   * depth exactly as the animals do (`Creature.svelte`), so a pumpkin is
   * always pumpkin-sized next to a cat. Each is layered by where it meets the
   * ground, so an animal walking the patch passes in front of some and behind
   * the rest.
   *
   * The vines and leaves are the backdrop's, so they are always behind every
   * piece. Each piece therefore sits with its foot on its row's vine, or
   * lower, so its row's leaves grow up behind it rather than out from under
   * it; and it stays clear of every leaf in the rows in front, which could
   * not pass in front of it. The middle bale sits in the straw in a gap in
   * the middle row, so no leaf reaches it.
