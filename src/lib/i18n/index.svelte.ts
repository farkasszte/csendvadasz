      "Shy Safari is a classroom noise monitor that runs in a web browser. Put it on the projector or interactive whiteboard and it shows a calm savanna, coral reef, night sky in deep space, Cretaceous floodplain, woodland clearing, rainforest jungle or Arctic sea ice. It listens to how loud the room is through the computer's microphone, and while the class stays under the volume goal, shy animals come out one at a time. It is the opposite of a bouncing noise meter: there is no score, no needle and no red warning light, so nothing makes being loud more interesting than being quiet.",
    "guide.useTitle": "Using it in class",
    "guide.use.open":
      "Open shysafari.com on the computer connected to your projector, pick the savanna, the coral reef, deep space, the prehistoric scene, the forest, the jungle or the Arctic, and press Start. The browser asks to use the microphone.",

      "Set the volume goal for the activity: Silent, Independent (quiet whispers) or Partner work (conversation voices), or drag the line on the meter to anywhere in between.",
    "guide.use.rate":
      "Let the class work. The first animal appears after 10 to 20 quiet seconds, and after that about one every five minutes of quiet work. Choose Relaxed, Normal or Lively in Settings, or type any number of minutes.",
    "guide.loudTitle": "How it decides the room is too loud",
    "guide.loud":
      "Short noises, like a knock at the door or a dropped book, don't count. The room has to stay over the goal for a bit first: about six seconds if it's just over, or about one second if it's much louder. Once it quiets down, the scene clears within three seconds.",
    "guide.calibrate":
      "Calibration is optional. Five seconds of silence and five seconds of normal talking teach the app what your room and your microphone sound like.",
    "guide.tooLoudTitle": "What happens when it gets too loud",
    "guide.tooLoud":
      "The scene clouds over, with a dusty haze on the savanna, murky water on the reef, interference in deep space, mist off the river in the prehistoric scene, fog between the trees in the forest, a tropical downpour in the jungle and a whiteout of blowing snow in the Arctic, and no new animals come out. What happens next is your choice:",
    "guide.tooLoud.flee":
      "Animals run away (the default). The scene freezes and, while the room stays too loud, one animal and then a few more every five seconds run off the edge of the screen. In deep space, they fade out into static instead.",

      "The savanna has 17 animals, from meerkats and zebras to giraffes, hippos and rhinos, with lions, leopards and elephants as the rare ones. The coral reef has 18, from clownfish and seahorses to sea turtles and octopuses, with hammerhead sharks, manta rays and whale sharks as the rare ones. Deep space has 17 sightings for older students, from satellites, asteroids and astronauts to the space station, comets and Saturn-like planets, with a spiral galaxy, a black hole, a pulsar and a ring nebula as the rare ones. The prehistoric scene has 17 animals from the very end of the age of dinosaurs, drawn with up-to-date science, from small mammals, lizards and feathered raptors to Triceratops and Ankylosaurus, with Tyrannosaurus, Quetzalcoatlus and the giant Alamosaurus as the rare ones. The forest has 17 woodland animals, from chipmunks, robins and hedgehogs to raccoons, foxes and deer, with a gray wolf, a black bear and a moose as the rare ones. The jungle has 17 rainforest animals, from poison dart frogs, toucans and capuchin monkeys to sloths, macaws and orangutans, with jaguars, gorillas and tigers as the rare ones. The Arctic has 17 animals, from lemmings, puffins and arctic foxes to caribou, walruses and belugas, with polar bears, narwhals and bowhead whales as the rare ones. Common animals turn up often and rare ones are a real event that many sessions will not see at all.

    "guide.what":
      "Shy Safari es un medidor de ruido para el aula que funciona en el navegador. Ponlo en el proyector o en la pizarra digital y muestra una sabana, un arrecife de coral, un cielo del espacio profundo, una llanura del Cretácico, un claro del bosque, una selva tropical o el hielo ártico tranquilos. Escucha lo fuerte que suena la clase a través del micrófono del ordenador y, mientras la clase se mantiene por debajo del límite de volumen, van apareciendo animales tímidos uno a uno. Es lo contrario de un medidor de ruido que salta: no hay puntuación, ni aguja, ni luz roja de aviso, así que hacer ruido nunca resulta más interesante que estar en silencio.",

    "guide.loud":
      "Los ruidos cortos, como un golpe en la puerta o un libro que se cae, no cuentan. La clase tiene que pasarse del límite durante un rato: unos seis segundos si se pasa un poco, o alrededor de un segundo si hay mucho más ruido. Cuando vuelve la calma, la escena se aclara en tres segundos.",

Lo que pasa después lo eliges tú:",
    "guide.tooLoud.flee":
      "Los animales huyen (la opción por defecto). La escena se congela y, mientras siga habiendo demasiado ruido, un animal y luego unos cuantos más cada cinco segundos salen corriendo de la pantalla. En el espacio profundo, en cambio, se desvanecen entre la estática.",

    "guide.animals":
      "La sabana tiene 17 animales, desde suricatas y cebras hasta jirafas, hipopótamos y rinocerontes, con leones, leopardos y elefantes como los más raros. El arrecife de coral tiene 18, desde peces payaso y caballitos de mar hasta tortugas marinas y pulpos, con tiburones martillo, mantarrayas y tiburones ballena como los más raros. El espacio profundo tiene 17 avistamientos pensados para estudiantes mayores, desde satélites, asteroides y astronautas hasta la estación espacial, cometas y planetas como Saturno, con una galaxia espiral, un agujero negro, un púlsar y una nebulosa anular como los más raros. La prehistoria tiene 17 animales del final de la era de los dinosaurios, dibujados según la ciencia actual, desde pequeños mamíferos, lagartos y raptores con plumas hasta Triceratops y Ankylosaurus, con Tyrannosaurus, Quetzalcoatlus y el gigantesco Alamosaurus como los más raros. El bosque tiene 17 animales, desde ardillas listadas, petirrojos y erizos hasta mapaches, zorros y ciervos, con un lobo gris, un oso negro y un alce como los más raros. La selva tiene 17 animales de la selva tropical, desde ranas venenosas, tucanes y monos capuchinos hasta perezosos, guacamayos y orangutanes, con jaguares, gorilas y tigres como los más raros. El Ártico tiene 17 animales, desde lemmings, frailecillos y zorros árticos hasta caribúes, morsas y belugas, con osos polares, narvales y ballenas de Groenlandia como los más raros. Los animales comunes aparecen a menudo y los raros son todo un acontecimiento que muchas sesiones no llegan a ver. Cada escena guarda sus propios animales, y la colección recuerda todos los que la clase ha visto.",

Il écoute le niveau sonore de la salle grâce au micro de l'ordinateur et, tant que la classe reste sous l'objectif de volume, des animaux timides sortent un par un.

L'espace profond compte 17 observations pour les plus grands, des satellites, astéroïdes et astronautes à la station spatiale, aux comètes et aux planètes comme Saturne, avec une galaxie spirale, un trou noir, un pulsar et une nébuleuse annulaire parmi les plus rares. La préhistoire compte 17 animaux de la toute fin de l'ère des dinosaures, dessinés d'après la science actuelle, des petits mammifères, lézards et raptors à plumes aux Triceratops et Ankylosaurus, avec Tyrannosaurus, Quetzalcoatlus et le géant Alamosaurus parmi les plus rares. La forêt compte 17 animaux, des tamias, rouges-gorges et hérissons aux ratons laveurs, renards et cerfs, avec un loup gris, un ours noir et un élan parmi les plus rares. La jungle compte 17 animaux de la forêt tropicale, des grenouilles venimeuses, toucans et capucins aux paresseux, aras et orangs-outans, avec les jaguars, les gorilles et les tigres parmi les plus rares. L'Arctique compte 17 animaux, des lemmings, macareux et renards arctiques aux caribous, morses et bélugas, avec les ours polaires, les narvals et les baleines boréales parmi les plus rares.

A számítógép mikrofonjával figyeli, milyen hangos a terem, és amíg az osztály a hangerő-cél alatt marad, egyszerre egy félénk állat jön elő.

A korallzátonyon 18 él, a bohóchalaktól és csikóhalaktól a tengeriteknősökig és polipokig; a ritkák a pörölycápa, a manta-rája és a cetcápa. A mélyűrben 17 észlelés vár, idősebb diákoknak: műholdaktól, aszteroidáktól és űrhajósoktól az űrállomásig, üstökösökig és gyűrűs bolygókig; a ritkák a spirálgalaxis, a fekete lyuk, a pulzár és a gyűrűs köd. Az őskor jelenetben 17 állat él a dinoszauruszok korának legvégéről, a mai tudás szerint rajzolva: kis emlősöktől, gyíkoktól és tollas raptoroktól a triceratopszig és az ankylosaurusig; a ritkák a Tyrannosaurus, a Quetzalcoatlus és az óriás Alamosaurus. Az erdőben 17 állat él, csíkosmókusoktól, vörösbegyektől és sünöktől a mosómedvékig, rókákig és őzekig; a ritkák a szürke farkas, a fekete medve és a jávorszarvas. A dzsungelben 17 állat él, nyílméregbékáktól, tukánoktól és kapucinusmajmoktól a lajhárokig, arapapagájokig és orangutánokig; a ritkák a jaguár, a gorilla és a tigris. A Jeges-tengeren 17 állat él, lemmingektől, lundáktól és sarki rókáktól a rénszarvasokig, rozmárokig és belugákig; a ritkák a jegesmedve, a narvál és a grönlandi bálna.
